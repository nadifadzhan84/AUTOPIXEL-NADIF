## Pixel Promo Region Matrix

As of **March 31, 2026**, Google's official Pixel offer page lists the **Pixel 10 Pro / Pixel 10 Pro XL / Pixel 10 Pro Fold** Google AI Pro promo across the following region groups. Actual eligibility still depends on device purchase + activation, account status, billing profile, and Google's live eligibility checks.

| Region Group | Countries / Regions Listed by Google | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| USA & North America | Canada, Mexico, United States | Listed on the official Pixel offer help page |
| Europe | Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom | Listed on the official Pixel offer help page |
| Asia-Pacific | Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan | Listed on the official Pixel offer help page |

Important notes:

- Google also lists **Japan** separately on the same Pixel offer page for a shorter trial on some Pixel Pro offer rows, so trial length can vary by country and device row.
- Google AI Pro itself is supported in a much wider set of countries and regions than the Pixel-device promo. That means the plan may exist in a country even when the Pixel promo is not officially listed there.
- This bot can only check for offer visibility and eligibility. It cannot make an account eligible in a country or billing profile that Google does not support.

Important: old inline panels sent before the latest update still contain the old non-working inline-query buttons. Send `/start` again to get the new working control panel.

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome installed
- A Telegram bot token from `@BotFather`
- Internet connection
- Optional: `proxies.txt` if you want proxy mode
- Full browser automation is best supported on Windows, Linux, or macOS with desktop Chrome available

## Quick Start

For the full plain-text run guide, see [`CARA JALANKAN.txt`](CARA%20JALANKAN.txt).

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Windows Command Prompt (CMD)

```bat
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Android Termux

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y python git clang rust libffi openssl
cd /path/to/AUTOPIXEL
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python main.py
```

Termux note: the Telegram bot process can run in Termux, but Chrome-based Google login automation normally requires a desktop-class Chrome/WebDriver environment.

## Detailed Setup Notes

### Environment file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill what you need:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
BOT_HEADER_MEDIA_URL=
CHROME_BIN=
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=
PROXY_ENABLED=1
PROXY_FILE_PATH=
PROXY_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=90
PROXY_QUARANTINE_SECONDS=300
PROXY_QUARANTINE_THRESHOLD=3
```

Notes:

- `BOT_HEADER_MEDIA_URL` supports a local image path, image URL, GIF URL, or MP4 URL
- if `BOT_HEADER_MEDIA_URL` is empty, the bot uses the bundled local banner asset
- if `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` is empty, the runtime falls back to automatic driver resolution

### Optional proxies

The repository includes a sample `proxies.txt` in the project root.
Edit that file directly if you want proxy mode.

If you want the bot to start in direct mode by default, set `PROXY_ENABLED=0`.
Leaving `PROXY_FILE_PATH` empty does not disable proxy mode. It only falls back to the default `proxies.txt` path.

Supported formats:

```text
http://ip:port
http://user:pass@ip:port
https://user:pass@ip:port
socks5://ip:port
ip:port:user:pass
user:pass@ip:port
```

## Typical Flow

1. Send `/start`
2. Send `/lang_id` if you want Indonesian UI
3. Send `/login`
4. Enter email
5. Enter password, or `password|totp_secret`
6. Check `/ip` or `/proxy`
7. Send `/check_offer`
8. If 2FA is requested, send the 6-digit code in Telegram
9. Review the result or debug artifacts

## Success Example

This is a simple example so users can recognize a normal successful flow:

```text
You: /start
Bot: Pixel Control Panel opens

You: /login
Bot: Please enter your Google email address

You: user@gmail.com
Bot: Email accepted. Now send your password

You: yourpassword
Bot: ✅ Session Ready
Bot: A fresh Pixel 10 Pro profile is ready for this session

You: /check_offer
Bot: ⏳ Starting secure check...
Bot: 🌍 Active Proxy Panel ...
Bot: ✅ Login successful
Bot: 🎉 Gemini Pro Offer Found! 🔗 https://one.google.com/...
```

## How Users Know It Worked

- Login step is successful when the bot shows `✅ Session Ready`
- Proxy/direct check is successful when `/ip` or `/proxy` shows the active network identity
- Offer check is successful when the bot shows `🎉 Gemini Pro Offer Found!`
- If no offer exists, the bot will say no active offer was found and may attach screenshot/HTML debug artifacts

## Proxy and IP Notes

- `/proxy` shows the active proxy for the session and pool availability
- `/ip` shows the effective network identity
- `/disable_proxy` locks the session to direct/local IP
- `/rotate_proxy` re-enables proxy mode for the session and chooses another proxy
- when proxy transport fails, `/check_offer` can rotate automatically

## Debug Artifacts

When no offer is found, the bot can save:

- screenshot `.png`
- page source `.html`

Artifacts are stored under:

```text
logs/offer_debug/chat_<chat_id>/
```

This helps distinguish:

- no eligible promo
- regular paid Google AI Pro plan only
- page rendering or scanner mismatch

## Security Notes

- Credentials are kept in memory for the active session only
- Passwords are wiped after use in the offer-check flow
- Sessions expire automatically after the configured TTL
- Automation may still trigger Google security challenges depending on account risk and region context

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `No module named 'telegram'` or another missing package | Activate `.venv`, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again |
| `409 Conflict` | Stop duplicate `main.py` bot processes and restart one instance only |
| `/check_offer` says no credentials | Run `/login` again because the session password has already been cleared |
| Proxy is selected but traffic still looks direct, or proxy precheck fails | Check `/proxy` and `/ip`, then rotate or replace the proxy pool, or switch to direct mode |
| No offer found | Review account region, billing profile, payments setup, and whether the promo was already claimed |
| Termux runs the bot but browser automation fails | Use Windows, Linux, or macOS with desktop Chrome for full automation support |
